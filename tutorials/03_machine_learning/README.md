# Machine Learning Basics

Dive into the fundamentals of machine learning with practical examples and hands-on exercises.

## What You'll Learn

- Machine learning concepts and terminology
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Classification and regression algorithms
- Model evaluation and validation
- Feature engineering basics

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Python Basics](../01_basics/README.md) and [Data Visualization](../02_data_visualization/README.md)
- Understanding of statistics and probability (helpful but not required)

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Machine Learning
- What is machine learning?
- Types of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
- Common applications and use cases

### 2. Supervised Learning
- **Classification**: Predicting categories (e.g., spam/not spam)
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices)
- Popular algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Training vs testing data
- Cross-validation
- Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RÂ²

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Data preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Feature selection

## Algorithms Covered

| Algorithm | Type | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|----------|------|------|
| Linear Regression | Regression | Simple relationships | Interpretable, fast | Limited to linear relationships |
| Decision Tree | Both | Clear rules | Easy to understand | Can overfit |
| Random Forest | Both | General purpose | Robust, handles overfitting | Less interpretable |
| K-Means | Clustering | Customer segmentation | Simple, efficient | Requires choosing K |
